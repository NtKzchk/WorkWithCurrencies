The CoinCap API was used in the work. A multi-page application with navigation has been implemented in the work, in which the main page displays a list of the top 10 currencies provided by API and three buttons that transfer to forms for viewing detailed information about the currency, for searching for a currency by name or code, and for converting currencies.
